<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>
    MetaFilter is a publicly-viewable community with three pillars: sharing and talking about “stuff found on the Internet”
    on various subjects, asking and answering questions, and discussing popular media.
    We work, imperfectly, to be a friendly and inclusive harassment-free zone.
</p>

<p>We hope you&nbsp;ll join us!</p>
